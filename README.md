<h1>User Verified Billing and Shopping Experience for a Sports Facility. </h1>



<h3> Problem Statement</h3>


<h3>Our Solution</h3>
Users register on the application and receive a unique QR code. They visit shops in the stadium, scan the QR code, browse products, and make purchases. The price is deducted from their virtual wallets in the real-time database after registration. Optional features include a loyalty program and data analytics for company insights. Secure authentication ensures safe transactions and a cash-free experience.
